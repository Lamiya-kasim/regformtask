üîê How OTP Login Works:

*User enters their email on the login page.

*A random 6-digit OTP is generated.

*OTP is emailed to the user.

*User enters the OTP within 5 minutes.

*If OTP matches and is not expired, user is logged in and go to the dashboard

*A new user account is created automatically if it doesn't already exist.


üß™ Testing the Feature
Make sure your Gmail credentials are correct in .env.

Use the login form to enter your email.

Check your email inbox for the OTP.

Submit the OTP in the next screen to log in.


üìå Notes
OTP expires after 5 minutes.

OTP is valid for one-time use only.

No password is stored ‚Äî login is entirely via OTP.
